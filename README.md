# React Prices
React Prices is a work-in-progess app to display Uber price comparisons. The goal here is to build a working webapp using just React. No Redux, Flux, JSX, NPM, Webpack, even CSS. With the exception of the initial HTML, the aim is to use as much Vanilla Javascript and React as possible.

Special thanks to James K. Nelson for his amazing work on using React
